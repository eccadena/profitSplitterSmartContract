## Associate Profit Splitter Smart Contract

This contract is a very simple smart contract that allows an entity to pay 3 employees equal amounts to their addresses.

These amounts may result in a remainder that, in total, would not equal to the total amount to pay out to the employees. This contract will send this amount back to the caller of the smart contract.

## Tired Profit Splitter Smart Contract

This contract takes the previous contract to the next level. 

This contract allows the caller to send a percentage of an amount (via points out of a percentage of 100) to their employee's addresses. As the previous contract did, this contract will send the remaining amount back BUT this time will send the remaining amount to the CEO (one of the higher ranking/tiered employees).
